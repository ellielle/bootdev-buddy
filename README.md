# Boot.dev Stats

This app provides a GUI to collect and show data from [Boot.dev's leaderboard page](https://boot.dev/leaderboard).

## Why?

I'm a fan of monitoring software, making it look nice, and making it easy to get the information you want at a glance. I thought having a buddy app to the [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev) curriculum that could more integrate a student's experience with others, while also monitoring your own progress, would be fun.

## Live Development

To run in live development mode, run `wails dev` in the project directory. This will run a Vite development
server that will provide very fast hot reload of your frontend changes. If you want to develop in a browser
and have access to your Go methods, there is also a dev server that runs on http://localhost:34115. Connect
to this in your browser, and you can call your Go code from devtools.

## Building

To build a redistributable, production mode package, use `wails build`.
