# Boot.dev Stats

This app provides a GUI to collect and show data from [Boot.dev's leaderboard page](https://boot.dev/leaderboard).

## Motivation

After getting to the level of "Archmage" myself, I wondered what the average time for a student to become an archmage was. Then I wondered a bunch of similar things, and so this was born.

I've wanted to use [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) and thought this would be a great chance to present data they provide in new ways.
